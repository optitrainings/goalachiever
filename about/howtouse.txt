f'Here is an <b>example</b> of how to use Goal Achiever: \n1. Identify which big projects, assignments you need to finish in the upcoming week. \nCapture them in Strategic goals. \n<i>E.g. Submit new chapter of my project</i> \n\U00002B07 \n2. Identify which tasks you need to complete during the week in order to achieve these goals. \nCapture them in General tasks List. \n<i>E.g. 1 - write 10th chapter (Mon), 2 - discuss the chapter with supervisor (Tue), 3 - email the chapter to team leader (Wed)</i> \n\U00002B07 \n3. When you plan your upcoming day, look through the General tasks List and select the tasks on which you want to focus today. \nTransfer them to Plan for the day. Add other tasks if needed. \n<i>E.g. 1 - write 10th chapter (Mon), 2 - swim for 1 hr</i> \n\U00002B07 \n4. Switch on FOCUS regime to get hourly reminders to focus and discipline yourself to work on the planned tasks. \nIf a task is completed, indicate it in the Plan. \n\U00002B07 \n5. At the end of the day look through your Plan and either indicate the remaining tasks as completed or transfer them back to General tasks List. \nHave a look at all completed tasks today in Completed tasks Report and click Get Points. \n\U00002B07 \n6. On the following day once you receive the reminder to create a Plan for the day, repeat the same cycle. \n\U00002B07 \n7. At the end of the week look through your Strategic Goals, make necessary adjustments.'
