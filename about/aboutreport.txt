f'\U00002705 <b>Completed tasks Report</b> - section where your completed tasks are captured. \nYou can convert completed tasks into <b>Rating</b> points (one task gives one point). Once you confirm you want to get points, all completed tasks will be deleted.\n<b>Tip:</b> Exchange completed tasks for points once a day when you conclude your day. Before you do that, look through all the completed tasks to get a sense of achievement. \nIf you mark a task as completed in General tasks List or Plan for the day, it gets removed from the List/Plan and gets added to the Report. You can <b>transfer</b> it back to the List/Plan.'
